        <p>My design space has three dimensions: targets (what to change), actions (how to change), and impacts.
        This design space was derived by reviewing 104 data visualization articles from the New York Times and 
        the Wall Street Journals. Those articles were reviewed through content analysis and open-coding.</p>

        <p>The figure is the example demonstration of design pattern cards. They represent the component design pattern 
        of the above design space. The front side of a card has its name and color/shape indices. The back side of a card has its visual and 
        verbal description.</p>
