        <h1>SNU FactCheck</h1>
        <p>
          SNU FactCheck is a fact-checking service where general people report social issues and professional journalists check their facts. 
          This service is the first service in Korea that collects factcheck contents from various sources. At first, it started with 7 
          media outlets, but now there are 27, including the top 3 broadcasting companies (KBS, MBC, and SBS) and 
          the top 2 newspaper companies (Chosun and Jungang). In other words, it was our mission to effectively visualize the factcheck 
          contents from multiple journalists, which are apt to be too lengthy to read. Therefore, my team suggested FactMeter, a 
          gauge-like object showing the degree of an issue's factuality. Also, my mission as a front-end developer was to vary the card 
          UI elements to fit various screen types.

          The idea of FactMeter was proposed by the director, and the designer developed this into realizable one. My job was to make this 
          able to represent the degree of factuality. Basically, the needle of a FactMeter moves along with the issue's fact-score (1-5). 
          An easier way might be to provide a static FactMeter with the mean of the fact-score. However, the fact-score cannot be pooled 
          because each media outlet had a different value system and an average score might ignore minor opinionss. Thus, the needle should 
          be dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a conflict between two options. One is that all the scores need to be presented withina short amount of time. 
          The other is that if the needle moves so fast, it might not be recognizable. This debate might be common issue when 
          the movement of an element is actually one of visual variables of a visualization. In order to obtain an appropriate speed 
          of the needle's movement, I casually tested several spped options with groups of people, and applied it to the final system.

          A card user interface is highly applicable to a system presenting a number of information objects because it can easily mark 
          each piece of information. Since the service was targeted to general audience, the cards should be altered in accordance with 
          screen sizes. There were two major variations with different layout hierarchy and information elements. Therefore, I had to 
          precisely control CSS positioning features. For example, in the desktop version, the position of each element could be controlled 
          by absolute values, but by relative values in the mobile version because screen width cannot be determined.

          Nowadays, a grid system is pervasive for responsive design, and 12-equal-width grid system is conventional. However, 
          the existing Bootstrap and Materialize cannot be applied because our card consisted of specific information elements and 
          they demanded a certain amount of space. Therefore, I had to implement a custom grid system that fit to our card design.s
